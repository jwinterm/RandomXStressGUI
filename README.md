#RandomXStressGUI

This program provides an easy to use GUI interface for the RandomX benchmarking tool developed by 00-matt here https://github.com/00-matt/randomx-stress.

Give it a couple seconds to start up and a couple seconds after pressing Start.

Checking Hugepages causes it to crash on my computer, but I think it's just cause I don't have hugepages enabled (it crashes if I try to run the underlying program from command line with -H also).
